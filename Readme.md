# Intro
I will be upfront, this code was largely written by AI. I do have experience in professional software development, but it is old and not in python.
This tool is meant as an accessibility aid first, as i myself have ADHD and with that can come issues with speech processing.
My goal is to make the lives of anyone with issues regarding hearing or processing speech easier and provide a low cost tool that I can use to make my life easier when listening to lectures, as well as a way to provide subtitles to meetings I am providing technical support for.
It is designed to run entirely offline and as such once the relevant version of whisper is installed it can be run on an air gapped system for security should you want subtitles for a meeting regarding private matters

As time goes on I hope to improve this tool greatly and eventually rewrite it in a language like rust or go (not sure how well that will go) this is because I want it to be able to run on the cheapest hardware possible as I am writing it on an 8th gen intel i5.
I do also hope to make some sort of hardware unit which I may sell to make set up easier for those who can afford it, but I plan to keep the code open. Not that it's strictly necessary, if I can make this then I imagine a lot of people can as well

better README and code improvements to come

also to note. This code only works with python version 3.13 not 3.14 which as of writing this is the most current version.
Once I have time to do so, I will either find a work around that allows the latest python or I will include instructions in this README on how to install and set this unfortunate configuration up
